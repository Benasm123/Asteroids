# Asteroids
A small weekend project to try out ECS.
Created using C++, SDL2, and SDL2 Image.

### Build
Nothing provided to build.
First need to build SDL and SDL Image, then build entry.cpp and game.cpp, linking to the sdl libraries and place SDL dll files in the same directory as the exe.

### TODO
